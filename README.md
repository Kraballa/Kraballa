- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kraballa, I'm a software engineer working fulltime at Vector Informatik GmbH
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in difficult computational problems (like SAT which I wrote my thesis on), game development, small web and practical applications for web technologies, networking
- ðŸ”¥ I love coding and have done many [projects](https://kraballa.net/) that I'm proud of. I wrote a small [ebook reader](https://ebook.kraballa.net/) that runs in the web. I made several (noncommercial) games from scratch with a [custom engine](https://github.com/Kraballa/MonocleRedux), here's a [fishing and building game](https://youtu.be/qOIECLcgGXw), or an [action rpg](https://youtu.be/UUHIKTK7KCQ). I have an interest in processor emulation, I wrote an emulator for the [Chip8](https://github.com/Kraballa/Chip8-Emulator) and a WIP [gameboy emulator project](https://github.com/Kraballa/GameboyEmulator) that has already sucked up weeks of my time. I've also developed a small [programming language](https://github.com/Kraballa/AntlrLangDev) using Antlr.
